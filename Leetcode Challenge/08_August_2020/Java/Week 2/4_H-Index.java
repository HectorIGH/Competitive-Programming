//Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
//
//According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
//
//Example:
//
//Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
//Output: 3 
//Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
//             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
//             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
//             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
//Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
//
//   Hide Hint #1  
//An easy approach is to sort the array first.
//   Hide Hint #2  
//What are the possible values of h-index?
//   Hide Hint #3  
//A faster approach is to use extra space.
