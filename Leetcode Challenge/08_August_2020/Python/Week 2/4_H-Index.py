#Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
#
#According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
#
#Example:
#
#Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
#Output: 3 
#Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
#             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
#             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
#             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
#Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
#
#   Hide Hint #1  
#An easy approach is to sort the array first.
#   Hide Hint #2  
#What are the possible values of h-index?
#   Hide Hint #3  
#A faster approach is to use extra space.

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        lc = len(citations)
        freq = [0] * (lc + 1)
        total = 0
        for c in citations:
            if c > lc:
                freq[lc] += 1
            else:
                freq[c] += 1
        
        for i in range(lc, -1, -1):
            total += freq[i]
            if total >= i:
                return i
        return 0
